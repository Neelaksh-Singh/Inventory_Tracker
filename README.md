# Inventory Tracker

In this project, I designed an inventory tracking web application for a logistics company, with the functionality of creating, editing and deletion of product.

## ðŸš© ABSTRACT

For the backend design, I utilized Python Flask and sqlalchemy for product uploading, storing and duplicate checking purposes. In particular, we used the HTTP post action to trigger the upload process of product, and built-in functionality of HTML5 to check the data integrity. Also used WTForms for handling form data validation.
The webisite uses flash a component of Flask which makes user have a better sense of their interaction with the webpage.

There is an added functionality of exporting product data to a CSV file. This uses the csv library and stores the generated files in <b>Generated_CSV</b> folder.

## ðŸ’» Installation

`!!! Must have Python installed. !!!` <br>

<b>Port 80 must be reserverd</b> <br>

Python 3.9+ is required to run code from this repo. 

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/Neelaksh-Singh/Shopify_Engineer_Intern_Challenge.git
$ cd Shopify_Engineer_Intern_Challenge/
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python app.py
```
After this step Your Flask app will be running at **localhost:8085** 

## What's next for this repo

I plan to add features that simulate a warehouse environment and handles balancing quantities over warehouses. Feature like Transfers which lets you move items into the central warehouse (and vice-versa), along with to and fro from various locations and also transfer tracking system are some of the most desired in the future.
